# Deploy Frontend to Railway - Step by Step Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** Ready to Deploy

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Go to Railway Dashboard

Open: https://railway.com/project/b7689a85-7397-47fc-a821-0d15e09de530

---

### 2. Create New Service

1. Click **"+ New"** button
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose repository: **Zhihong0321/Eternalgy-EMS**
4. Railway will detect the repository

---

### 3. Configure Service

**Service Settings:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Service Name** | `frontend` or `ems-frontend` |
| **Root Directory** | `frontend` |
| **Build Method** | Auto-detected (Dockerfile) |

**How to set Root Directory:**
1. Click on the new service
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Service"** section
4. Set **"Root Directory"** to: `frontend`
5. Click **"Save"**

---

### 4. Deploy

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect `frontend/railway.toml`
2. Use `frontend/Dockerfile` for build
3. Build the multi-stage Docker image
4. Deploy with Nginx

**Expected build time:** ~2-3 minutes

---

### 5. Get Public URL

Once deployed:
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Railway will provide a URL like:
   ```
   https://ems-frontend-production.up.railway.app
   ```

---

## ✅ Verify Deployment

### Test 1: Health Check

Visit the Railway URL in browser:
```
https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
```

**Expected:** EMS Dashboard loads with navigation tabs

---

### Test 2: WebSocket Connection

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for:
   ```
   ✅ WebSocket connected
   ```

If you see "WebSocket disconnected", wait 10 seconds for auto-reconnect.

---

### Test 3: End-to-End Flow

**Complete Test:**

1. **Open Frontend URL** → Should see Dashboard tab

2. **Switch to Simulator Tab**
   - Device ID: "RAILWAY-TEST-001"
   - Power: 80 kW
   - Volatility: 15%
   - Interval: 10 seconds
   - Click **"Start Auto-Send"**

3. **Switch to Dashboard Tab**
   - Should see real-time updates
   - Chart should populate
   - Block stats should update
   - Progress bar should grow

4. **Verify Data in Backend**
   ```bash
   # Check readings were inserted
   curl https://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app/api/debug/meters/list

   # Check current block
   curl https://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app/api/debug/blocks/calculate-current/RAILWAY-TEST-001
   ```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Application failed to respond"

**Solution:** Check build logs
1. Go to service in Railway
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click latest deployment
4. Check **"Build Logs"** and **"Deploy Logs"**

---

### Issue: WebSocket won't connect

**Possible causes:**

1. **Backend not running**
   - Check: https://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app/api/health
   - Should return `{"status":"ok",...}`

2. **Wrong WebSocket URL**
   - Frontend expects: `wss://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app`
   - Check browser console for connection attempts

3. **CORS issue**
   - Backend already has `cors` enabled with `*` origin
   - Should work out of the box

---

### Issue: Build fails with npm errors

**Solution:** Check package.json
- All dependencies should install
- If fails, check Railway logs for specific error
- May need to add `--legacy-peer-deps` to npm install

---

## 📊 Expected Railway Services

After deployment, you should have:

```
Railway Project: Eternalgy-EMS
├── PostgreSQL (Database)          ✅ Running
├── Backend (Node.js)              ✅ Running
│   └── URL: eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app
└── Frontend (Nginx)               🆕 Deploying
    └── URL: ems-frontend-production.up.railway.app
```

---

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Checklist

After frontend deploys successfully:

- [ ] Frontend URL loads
- [ ] Dashboard tab visible
- [ ] Simulator tab visible
- [ ] WebSocket connects (check browser console)
- [ ] Simulator can send readings
- [ ] Dashboard receives real-time updates
- [ ] Chart displays data
- [ ] Progress bar works
- [ ] Peak hour badge shows correctly
- [ ] Block statistics calculate correctly

---

## 📱 Mobile Testing

Once deployed, test on mobile:

1. Open frontend URL on phone
2. Go to Simulator tab
3. Start auto-send (10s interval)
4. Switch to Dashboard tab
5. Verify real-time updates work on mobile

**Expected:** Fully responsive, works perfectly on phone! 📱

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Current Configuration:**
- ✅ Nginx with security headers
- ✅ CORS enabled on backend
- ✅ WebSocket over WSS (encrypted)
- ✅ HTTPS by default on Railway

**For Production (Future):**
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Restrict CORS origins
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Custom domain

---

## 📊 Monitoring

**Check Deployment Status:**
```bash
# Frontend health (Nginx)
curl https://your-frontend-url.railway.app

# Backend health (Node.js)
curl https://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app/api/health

# WebSocket test (browser console)
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://eternalgy-ems-production.up.railway.app')
ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected!')
```
