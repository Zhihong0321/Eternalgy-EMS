## 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Tasks (Start Here)
1. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Local/Railway PostgreSQL**
   - Get DATABASE_URL from Railway
   - Create `.env` file in backend
   - Run migration: `npm run db:migrate`

3. **Build Web-Based Simulator Page** (HTML + DevReady Kit)
   - Interactive controls (sliders for kW, volatility)
   - WebSocket connection to backend
   - Real-time status display

4. **Build Dashboard Page** (HTML + DevReady Kit + Recharts)
   - Real-time 30-min block chart
   - Current usage display
   - Peak hour indicator

5. **Test End-to-End**
   - Start backend: `npm run dev`
   - Open simulator on phone
   - Open dashboard on laptop
   - Verify real-time updates

## 📝 KEY DECISIONS MADE

| Topic | Decision | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Hosting | Railway (all services) | Single platform, easy deployment |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Reliable, Railway native support |
| MQTT Broker | Mosquitto | Lightweight, Docker-ready |
| Frontend Framework | React + TypeScript | Industry standard, type-safe |
| UI Library | DevReady Kit | User requirement, Tailwind-based |
| Chart Library | Recharts | Works well with React + Tailwind |
| kWh Calculation | Sum of readings × (1/60) | Accurate energy calculation |
| Peak Hours | 14:00 - 22:00 (2 PM - 10 PM) | Utility billing requirement |

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### 30-Min Block Calculation
```
Formula: Total kWh = Σ(Power_kW) × (1/60)
Source: ID 13 (Total Active Power) from MQTT data
Interval: Every minute (30 readings per block)
Block Start Times: :00 and :30 of every hour
```

### MQTT Configuration
```
Topic: platform/acrel/meter/json-v2/analog/0000
QoS: 1
Format: JSON
Interval: 60 seconds
Key Field: point[].id=13 (Total Active Power in kW)
```

### Database Tables
- `meters`: Device registry
- `energy_readings`: Raw 1-minute readings
- `thirty_min_blocks`: Aggregated 30-min kWh values

---

## 🚧 KNOWN BLOCKERS / OPEN QUESTIONS

### Resolved ✅
- [x] kWh calculation method confirmed
- [x] Peak hour definition confirmed (2 PM - 10 PM)
- [x] UI framework selected (DevReady Kit)
- [x] Deployment platform confirmed (Railway)

### Pending ⏳
- [ ] Railway MQTT broker configuration (need to test)
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection string format on Railway
- [ ] DevReady Kit npm package name (need to verify)
- [ ] WebSocket library choice (ws vs socket.io)

---

## 📈 PROGRESS TRACKER

### MVP Phases
- [x] Phase 0: Planning & Documentation (100%)
- [x] Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (100%) - Railway + PostgreSQL
- [x] Phase 2: Backend Development (100%) - WebSocket + API + Aggregator
- [x] Phase 3: Backend Deployment (100%) - **LIVE ON RAILWAY!** 🚀
- [ ] Phase 4: Frontend Development (0%) - Simulator + Dashboard pages
- [ ] Phase 5: Integration & Testing (0%)

### Overall Progress: **~60%** (Backend Deployed & Live!)

---

## 💡 NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **Start with simulator** - This will enable testing without waiting for real meters
2. **Use Docker Compose locally first** - Test MQTT + PostgreSQL before Railway
3. **Verify DevReady Kit installation** - Check npm package name and setup
4. **Consider using Prisma** - For type-safe database operations
5. **Set up environment variables** - `.env.example` for configuration
